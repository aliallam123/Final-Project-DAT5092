Analysis of Salary Factors in AI/ML Jobs
Project Overview
This repository contains a series of coded graphs that aim to analyze and understand the factors influencing salaries in AI and ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) jobs. Various types of graphs - including line, bar, heatmap, treemap, and scatter plots - are used to explore different determinants such as experience levels, company location, company size, work year, job title, and the ratio of remote workers. The goal is to uncover correlations and regressions to gain insights into what affects salary dynamics in the AI/ML sector.

Installation
To run these scripts, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
NumPy
Squarify (for the treepmap only)

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy squarify

Usage
To execute the scripts, simply run them in the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal.

Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python libraries:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
NumPy
Squarify
Ensure these are installed before running the scripts, as outlined in the Installation section.

Project Status
This repository is part of a final university assignment and is not open for contributions. It serves as a submission to demonstrate the application of data visualization in analyzing salary factors in the AI/ML industry.
